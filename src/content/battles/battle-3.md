"You can't hit what you can't see" is put to the test when the stealth force of N'lan cadre encounters the tanks of the Medvedican 1-15th.

## Commander Longford Advances

Fresh from his victory against the Land Train of the Kin, Commander Longford moved swiftly to advance his tanks into the outer districts of Helios Spire.

## N'lan

Rad Maniple 4 is a specialized Adeptus Mechanicus formation, renowned for their mastery over radiation-based weaponry and technology. Stationed on a desolate forge world, they harness the power of atomic decay to annihilate their enemies, often at great personal cost. Their tech-priests are highly irradiated, viewing their mutations as blessings from the Machine God. Feared across the galaxy, Rad Maniple 4 leaves a trail of radioactive devastation in their wake, their very presence a harbinger of death.

## Children of the Atom

The first sign of battle was not as sudden as a railgun shot, or as brutal as a hand-to-hand street fight. Instead, the integration cadre witnessed strange, archaic shells detonating high above their heads, showering them in some kind of dust. Within minutes, sickness began to set in among their ranks - soon after, this became both burns on skin and corrosion on armour. The radiation bombardment of the Adeptus Mechanicus was excellently executed, forcing the T'au units forward from their well-fortified positions into open ground that rapidly became a kill zone. A breakout was attempted by Kroot auxiliaries, supported by Breacher teams moving swiftly in Devilfish transports, but this was quickly blunted by Skitarii troops and the cadre was beset on all sides.

The Kin attempted to rally as best they could, their hardier constitutions helping them against the radiation sickness, but they were no match against the now rapidly advancing Martian forces. The final nail in the coffin was the death of the Hammerhead gunship support, their armour finally giving way to the toxic air and detonating their railgun cores - without heavy fire support, the Mechanicus could advance unhindered and the Cadre were forced to flee the field.
