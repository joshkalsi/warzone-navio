The first conflict of the campaign is joined, as two armoured columns meet in a storm of fire. Out on the road between cities, the 1st (15th) Medvedican Motorised division attempts to disrupt the Land Train of the Kin.

## The Land Train Advances

A physical train no longer, the Land Train has evolved from a simple armoured vehicle to a tactical concept akin to a juggernaut. A large formation of Hekatons and Sagitaurs, filled with all manner of Kin infantry, is charged with pushing forward into the enemy lines, heedless of terrain or enemy defences. Departing the Helios Spire, Ettok christened the train as Fersk Ã¾eim Vel (journey well) and unleashed it out into the wastes.

## Interception

Realising the threat that this sea of metal could cause if not properly checked, Commander Longford immediately moved to intercept with his tanks of the 1st (15th) Medvedican. Expertly using his knowledge of the planet's road system, the commander was able to cross the path of the Kin while they were still on the outskirts of the Spire, before they had been able to build up the momentum that made the Land Train so dangerous.

## Metal and Flesh

As the two armies met, Hekaton Land Fortresses of the Kin held the road itself, opposed by a brutal spearhead of Leman Russ tanks, led by Commander Longford himself. In the surrounding ruins, levelled by relentless advanced Basilisk shelling, Chimera carriers emptied their hulls of elite Kasrkin troops to assasult scouting posts of the Hernkyn Yaegirs and critical anti-tank positions of the Thunderkyn.

Ultimately, it was the leadership of Commander Longford who won the day. From the hatch of his Demolisher, the Heart of Iron, he was personally responsible for destroying two Hekatons and several squads of infantry, including vital Hearthguard reinforcements seeking to stem the tide of Imperium troops. Even a last ditch effort by the Kin to charge a Hekaton directly into the Heart of Iron failed to stop him. Although his tank was finally disabled, he escaped in the melee and returned to the front in rapidly requistioned Leman Russ; the sight of his survival spurring the Medvedican troops to finally rout the Kin.

## Helios Spire Vulnerable

This victory, while early in the campaign, was critical for ensuring that the Kin were not able to run roughshod over the arena of battle. It also presented Ettok with a major problem, as his own Land Train tactics could easily be turned on him - without quick intervention, the armoured Imperial column could easily advance deep into the Spire itself. Ettok would have to turn to his T'au allies to achieve what he could not.
